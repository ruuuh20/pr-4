- The baseline of an 'inline-block' is the baseline of its last line box in the normal flow, unless it has either no in-flow line boxes or if its 'overflow' property has a computed value other than 'visible', in which case the baseline is the bottom margin edge. (stackoverflow)

* font-variation-settings - CSS property provides low-level control over variable font characteristics, by specifying the four letter axis names of the characteristics you want to vary, along with their values. This property is a low-level mechanism designed to set variable font features where no other way to enable or access those features exist. You should only use it when no basic properties exist to set those features (e.g. font-weight, font-style).
